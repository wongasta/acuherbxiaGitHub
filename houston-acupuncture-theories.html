<h1>Traditional Chinese Medicine Theories</h1>

<h2 id="qi">Qi Energy</h2>

<p class="firstP">Qi, its meaning is too broad, from the ancient philosophical doctrine of Qi is now usually
    referred to the air, angry, and fatigue, and can be described as ubiquitous in Chinese word. Here I would
    like to discuss is bio-Qi energy in Traditional Chinese Medicine, also known as source of the life, Qigong
    and martial arts focus on raising Qi energy, and, as I understand the concept of Qi energy between the two
    should be the same or basically the same.</p>

<p>In order to avoid the meaning of confused with other Qi concept, temporarily referred to as &quot;Qi energy&quot;,
    is the driving force behind the creation of life is to maintain the most basic element of biological
    phenomena. Is different from the electric, magnetic, infrared, and radiation instruments can be used as a
    human have not yet detected bio-energy, the situation is similar to the hundred years ago, the radioactivity
    of human cognition. Qi energy can only exist in vivo (perhaps also present in the atmosphere of plants in
    nature, so for many Chinese traditional health practice that under old trees have a stronger sense of
    practicing qigong), with the disappearance of life forms Qi energy can also disappear, such as trauma and
    accidents, or with the exhaust Qi energy of life also will be suspended, like the end of the disease and die
    of just old age.</p>

<p>Qi energy flows in the meridians (or body channels), to reach and supply of energy in the limbs, internal
    organs, so as to maintain the normal function of organs and systems, such as from the digestion, metabolism,
    exercise, from reproduction to the nerves, the immune system, have to rely on in the supply of Qi energy and
    thus be able to play the normal function of various systems.</p>

<p>Meridian is now known to be different from the nerves, blood vessels and lymphatic vessels than the other
    exists only in the living body, the connection of organs, limbs, blood vessels and neural network systems
    among the various systems. Nerve signals as nerve conduction and vascular circulation for blood cells, body
    fluids, and a variety of proteins, meridians as the carrier of Qi energy can be conducted for the exclusive.
    Meridian, situation may like looking for the understanding of radio waves cannot be in the railway and
    highway to look through. In the context of skin, muscle, veins and nerve between the carrier and its own
    path, just the naked eye does not see.</p>

<p>Qi energy and the meridian of the results show depends on a future cooperation zones in chemistry and physics
    to inventions, the need for new ways of thinking and experimental methods, because it is the living body,
    have so far different from the existing body specimens in vitro and in experimental methods. If it comes to
    Qi energy that can be of human cognition, and is able to operate the day, and now those who hope in the
    future be able to revive the frozen people body, but added that may be revived. Because they theoretically
    should be the body and cells are not damaged, and only because of the lack of a source of life - Qi energy,
    as long as they find appropriate ways to enter the Qi energy can on the list. (I wonder if that day is a
    blessing or a curse, if the world is full of immortality of the body, may leave more space for future
    generations). That day, nor be divided into Western and Eastern Traditional medicine, only the medical term,
    because the target is consistent: the treatment regimen (people see a doctor not only for the purpose of
    medical treatment, many in order to better health). Doctors will use new device to transfer Qi energy, and
    governance Qi energy, may have to use traditional methods such as acupuncture, qigong and herbal medicine,
    because this artificial synthetic Qi energy not as good as their original.</p>

<h2 id="illness">What Cause Illnesses</h2>

<p class="firstP">Many medical books addressed the question &ldquo;what caused the illnesses?&rdquo; This
    question has been
    asked throughout the human history. The aging/lifestyle related health problems are different with infection
    and epidemic diseases that occurred in the past.</p>

<p>General speaking , the diseases can be divided into three categories. The first factor is the external
    threats (bacteria, virus and other external pathogen). The second factor is the internal wound caused by the
    life style and aging related factors. The last factor is related to the traumatic injuries and genetic
    mutations, etc,.</p>

<p>Decades ago, most diseases are caused by bacteria, viruses, epidemic diseases, and surgical injury. After the
    discovery of anti-bacteria medicine and the improvement of our hygiene condition, the external threats
    became insignificant .</p>

<p>Now we often hear about the disease such as cancer, cholesterol, diabetes, back pain and skeletal injuries.
    All of these problems are not related to external factors directly, but instead, it&rsquo;s more related to
    our life style or aging . Smoking, drinking, over-eating, over-working, stress contribute to the problem,
    our life-span is more longer then before, so we have lot of new problems with the aging. Those new kind of
    diseases often invade elders. The chance of getting prostate cancer will more likely to occur to someone who&rsquo;s
    50+. All of these factors will affect the Qi energy, resulting weakening of Qi energy, which may cause
    mutation within our DNA. Finally, our organs, joints, bones, tissues and cells lost control and
    nourishment.</p>

<p>It is difficult to imagine that if we swallow a tablet of medicine it will cure those diseases the life style
    and aging related. I believe that the right way for treating those diseases is not directly to annihilate
    external threats or only broke some place to stop pathogenic pathway, my strategy of therapy for treating
    this kind of diseases is designated to improve and regulates the Qi energy by the therapy methods of
    acupuncture, herbal medicine or some self exercises like Qigong and suitable life style. Then get the
    control of body systems such as the immune, nerve, metabolize and bone-muscle systems. It will eventually
    restore back the normal function by improving the environment of these pathological changes of cells and
    genes.</p>

<p>Also I believe that the most effective medicine is keeping body in health condition, which means prevention
    is the primary concern for us. It is the best way to do some thing before we get cancer or othre
    illness.Traditional Chinese Medicine(TCM)</p>

<p>The Traditional Chinesel Mmedicine (TCM) has been around for more than 2000 years. It is a different medical
    system compare to the western medical systems. The TCM have a different history and ideology compared to the
    western modern medicines. For example, in the early stage of the TCM development, epidemic diseases were
    serious threat to human in west, while in China, the epidemic diseases are less of a treat. It might be the
    geographic factors that Chinese Empire was isolated from other empires. The peoples in that time are more
    aware in the importance of human body self.</p>

<p>From what I know , the TCM is a different theory that is very dissimilar from the western conventional
    medicine in the ways of understandings of diseases and health. The TCM&rsquo;s basic treatment is to improve
    and regulate the Qi (pronounced chee) energy to offer better resistance against both the external and
    interior pathogenic factors. This will improve the body&rsquo;s health condition. The therapy methods will
    include acupuncture, herbal medicine, moxibustion, Chinese therapy massage (Tuina), and self exercise
    methods like Qigong, Taiji and many more.</p>

<h2 id="acupuncture">Acupuncture</h2>

<p class="firstP">Acupuncture is one of the major methods for prevention and treatment of diseases in TCM.
    Acupuncturist
    inserts a needle to acupoint in the body surface, which use needling manipulation methods to induce and
    regulate the patient&rsquo;s Qi energy.</p>

<p>Because of the advancement within the human technology, the acupuncture needle has changed over time. The
    stainless and disposable needle is common use now, and with the aid of tubes, the needle is inserted much
    faster than before. During the needling sensation, the patient will feel almost no pain. By the manipulation
    of acupuncturist, the sensation of needling will induce soreness, numbness, a distention feeling or
    heaviness around the point even conduct to distance . Sometimes, patient will feel coldness, warmness,
    itching, pain, electric-shock feeling, etc. In principle, the patient will have a feeling of comfort.</p>

<p>Pain is a common symptom in many illnesses and occur in every part of our body. From muscle, skeletal and
    neurotic system to gynecology condition, acupuncture therapy has special effectiveness against illness that
    involves physical pain. Also, acupuncture is effective against others symptoms like rhinitis, asthma,
    constipation, and sleeping problems, and etc.</p>

<h2 id="herbal">Chinese Herbal Medicine</h2>

<p class="firstP">In Chinese herbal medicine, the different characters of herbal are employed to treat diseases
    and help the
    body to restore health. The species of herbal medicine is very broad, including plants, animals and mineral.
    Some of it is crude, while others are processed. The dosage form of herbal medicine have decoction, powder,
    pill, bolus, extract, ointment, plaster, medicated wine, medicated tea, distilled medicinal water, and etc.
    They can be taken through oral, external application, medicated diet, and etc. Recently, the concentrated
    granule is a new form of herbal medicine, it is easier for herbal quality control and drug
    administration.</p>

<p>The herbal medicine is very popular and commonly used for diseases treatment and prevention in TCM history
    and in modern China.</p>

<h2 id="decoction">Decoction</h2>

<p class="firstP">It is a liquid preparation, usually made by boiling drugs with water, or with a proper amount
    of other
    liquids (such as wine and vinegar) in some special cases. When preparing a decoction, drugs are put into a
    vessel in which the material's chemical property is comparative stable (such as earthenware, or enamel,
    never an iron or copper pot) and then clean water is poured in to submerge all the drugs. After the drugs
    are soaked for 30-60 minutes, the pot with the drugs is placed on fire, first quick-boiled, and then
    simmered. The drugs will be decocted for a certain period of time according to the different requirements,
    then the liquid decoction can be served (in some case, it need to be filtered). Mostly the decoction time is
    between 20 to 30 minutes, with repeats of the procedure. Usually one dose a day, taken twice in morning and
    evening.</p>

<p>Now, many peoples use the Concentrated Herbal Granule, it is soluble to hot water, is convenient to take.</p>


<h2 id="moxibustion">Moxibustion</h2>

<p class="firstP">Moxibustion is an external method by ignition of moxa wool in acupoint of skin for prevention
    and treatment.
    The theory is same with acupuncture. There are two types of Moxibustion: no scarring and scarring
    moxibustion.</p>

<p>Moxibustion therapy especially the scarring type have special effica cy in some chronic and stubborn
    diseases.</p>

<h2 id="massage">Chinese therapy massages (Tuina) and Japanese Shiatsu</h2>

<p class="firstP">The manipulation methods used in Chinese massage contains more than ten ways, including
    pushing, rolling, kneading, rubbing, scrubbing, grasping, pressing, tapping etc. The Japanese Shiatsu mainly
    use thumb pressing. The disease diagnosis and selection of the acupoint and channel are similar with the TCM
    theory, by massage to regulating the Qi function.</p>

<h2 id="qigong">Qigong and self exercise</h2>

<p class="firstP">Qigong is an art of self-training both for the body and mind, by regulating three elements of Qi gong:
    the
    body, breathing and mind. This will cultivate and strengthen the Qi energy, to preventing and curing
    diseases, which will strengthen healthiness and prolonging life.</p>

<p>The types of Qigong have static Qigong (that like the relaxation), inner-nourishing, roborant, heavenly
    circuit, dynamic Qigong that is eight-section brocade (Baduanjin) and Yijinjin, etc.</p>

<p>Form my understanding, the new born baby is in perfect condition of Qi energy because the Qi energy circulate
    through the body with no any obstruct and is full of strong force. Following the growth to adult, people get
    ambitions , stress and ill, and the Qi energy will be weakened. The goal of Qigong is try to get back to the
    original condition. The Qigong training is mainly the mind training - training the brain into a deep level
    of quietness, stop to think anything between exercise times. Because the quietness, Qi energy or Qi stream
    will start to move smoothly through the whole body, and the body Qi will be cultivated and strengthen. If
    you feel the Qi is getting stronger and stronger, then you are triumphant. The Qi feeling and strength vary
    from person to person, mostly is like a stream flow through the body in channel (technical word in TCM,
    almost acupoint is along the channels).</p>

<h2 id="sports">Sports and self exercise</h2>

<p class="firstP">Basically, the modern sports are good for competition and performance. They are suitable for young
    peoples
    but it&rsquo;s not designed for the elder people. The Chinese traditional sports are different to the modern
    sports, and they can be divided into two types - one is mainly used for martial arts, and another one is
    mainly used for health purposes.</p>

<p>Over the long history, Chinese created many kinds of self exercise for different age, sex, region, personal
    interests, and health conditions. So you can pick up one that is suitable to your body condition and to your
    personal interesting, since it will be easier for you to exercise anytime and anywhere. Persist exercise is
    very important for all kinds of health exercises.</p>

<h2 id="medicine">Medicine and poison</h2>

<p class="firstP">Everyone is different. Because of the differences between people, one particular medicine may be
    effective for that
    particular person. On the other hand, it could also be poisonous to another person.</p>

<p>Usually we accept the concept that the same medicine can treat different patients because they have same disease
    during the diagnosis. It is OK for diseases caused by external factors, but it is not a right treatment for diseases
    caused within life style and aging. The patients are very different in their age, sex, health conditions, life
    styles and health history, so we have to make different plans of treatment for everyone.</p>

<h2 id="smoxibustion">Scarring moxibustion</h2>

<p class="firstP">I once read an article sketches the Ming Dynasty who have do not remember the author and title, is an
    outsider
    mentioned Moxibustion. Author himself an official in the southern parts of the day caught a big robber, often forced
    into houses, rape women. Officials difficult to understand how 80-year-old man can still can do like this. Then
    privately asked, Robber, said: &quot;Nothing special, just every year have moxibustion treatment under the navel for
    decades.&quot;</p>

<p>On a famous acupuncture and moxibustion scientist, Mr. Tanan Cheng described the twenties of the last century,
    traveling Nagasaki, Japan, the culture of the region popular with moxibustion treatment. Any street or alley in the
    first end, there must be a moxibustion treatment rooms, physicians, and within the moxibustion technician.
    Moxibustion doctor do diagnosis and painting point mark, moxibustion technician burn herbal Ai (also known as moxa
    or Argy Wormwood Leaf) at the punctuation. At that time, moxibustion therapy is not common seen in China because
    Qing imperial court that unsightly. Later, I studied in Japan, also occasionally heard people talk about moxibustion
    treatment, saying that Kyoto is only a monk of a temple in the treatment, very effective.</p>

<p>Own over 40, all kinds of pain throughout the body began to appear. I do not know because the exertion injuries, or
    eating wrong, or other reasons, but I think it is related with the genetic constitution. Self-notebook from my
    father, there are a variety pain of neck, shoulder, waist, and leg constantly, but, while this year is already 85
    years old, still not have high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes and other internal organs diseases.
    Probably poison did not stay within the organs are outward divergence to the limbs, joints. Also have give myself
    acupuncture treatment, a long time is too cumbersome, and inconvenient in winter. Search literature, Chinese ancient
    culture of moxibustion was very popular and always on the treatment of hundreds of Zhuang (burn a column is called a
    Zhuang), not only medical treatment available, even as for stronger health purposes. Great Doctor Sun Simiao have
    &quot;To the health, the Zusanli Point should always moxibustion,&quot; the famous saying. It was until the Qing
    Dynasty, acupuncture and moxibustion treatment has become significantly reduced.</p>

<p>According to the traditional methods, to produce their own moxibustion sore ointment and moxibustion sore care is
    very troublesome thing. Moxibustion sore cream, etc. figured out the main purpose is to help moisturizing and onset
    of moxibustion sore, it hands out as Vaseline gauze and paper tape, so that moxibustion sore care dressing on the
    more convenient.</p>

<p>Moxa should be to preserve more than a few years old better, mellow flavor, the new moxa is spicy pungent. Fixed
    points later, when, as part of different, moxa cone, large or small, muscular fat may like jujube nuclear size,
    other parts can be the size of grain of wheat or soybeans, but also with people vary. Moxa cone from small mounting,
    in principle, need the entire area heat thoroughly. Or dozens or hundreds of Zhuang, most require forty to fifty
    minutes. The onset of Moxibustion is key point in whole process, an average of forty days or so. Occasionally the
    onset of moxibustion sore is not a thorough, and perhaps need to use qi energy and blood nourishing herbal medicine,
    or eating high-protein content of food in order to help moxibustion sore episode, can also needle acupuncture around
    the sores, through the lead role in qi energy in order to help induce the moxibustion sore onset. Each site should
    not be too much moxibustion, as many injured blood and qi energy consumption, and moxibustion sore penetrating
    maturation is not ideal, of course, have to justify it, and according to the strength of endowment by moxibustion
    were determined. If, after the color of pale scar moxibustion, which is toxic discharges have been outside, dark
    purple color, then maybe next year have to re-moxibustion</p>

<p>The pain of first few Zhuang is obvious, and then the pain reduced, and sometimes there is itching of the pleasure.
    This is, like acupuncture, some fear of needles as the fear of the tiger , some felt very happily, all vary.</p>

<p> I personally scarring moxibustion experience is that for various joint muscle pain effect of wind cold dampness
    good, and have a clear Warming strong role, feels even stronger than the number of American ginseng. Especially when
    practicing qigong, qi energy feeling more pronounced.</p>

<p><strong>Scarring moxibustion Mechanism of conjecture is as follows:</strong><br/>
</p>
<ol>
    <li>The nature of the Ai is warm, and themselves with the power to help Yang, which is the difference between
        moxibustion and electronic or cigarettes burns.
    </li>
    <li> The power of tonic qi of moxa fire can comparable to herbal ginseng.</li>
    <li>The burning pain produced by stimulation of its own like acupuncture, have a clear function of the meridians and
        flow of qi energy .
    </li>
    <li> Made moxibustion sore is the key to the whole process as a process of aseptic suppuration, local and in vivo
        with the septic poisoning caused by damp cold process directly excreted. Wind cold dampness and other toxic evil
        interpreted as abnormal protease expression, or abnormal or excessive. The future if given the opportunity,
        perhaps to be a test of whole genome and protein expression, (DNA Array, Protein Array), should not be one or
        two genetic changes, but rather was a regular change in communities.
    </li>
    <li>Made the long process of moxibustion sore, is the body's immune, neurological and other systematic and
        continuous stimulation to achieve the adjustment, the reconstruction of these systems function. Play a strong
        fitness role, especially effective in a variety of deficiency. Moxibustion Shihua-points used to spend the
        ancient rule tuberculosis, moxibustion Guan Yuan, Qi hai-Point Treatment of Diarrhea, impotence and other
        records.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>In addition, because warm-acupuncture-moxibustion and indirect moxibustion lack of the moxibustion sore process, it
    would have some weak. The none-fire herb induced moxibustion is given to the sores scarring moxibustion and indirect
    moxibustion in between, there is the process of moxibustion sore, but depth in varying degrees, may be easier for
    the patient and his family accepted by the public.</p>

<p>Direct moxibustion for penetrating pus is a special usage, is now due to the popularity of antibiotics and surgery,
    using the opportunity will be even less.</p>

<p>Of course, painlessly, and beauty of the people do not fit moxibustion, palm and other parts of craniofacial
    inappropriate for moxibustion. A result of life-long scar, need to be used with caution, after deliberation, these
    are common sense, no more to say.</p>

<p>There is a suggestion after the subcutaneous anesthesia use direct moxibustion, and perhaps this method can be used
    for thermal treatment, on the pain syndrome seems to be defective, because of the pain stimulus itself have a clear
    function of the meridians and flow of qi energy, to achieve the pain improvement effect.</p>

<h2 id="calorie">Calorie restriction and longevity mice</h2>

<p class="firstP">Life of mice in the study area, there is a very classic and well-known theory is that calorie
    restriction can extend
    life span of mice, (Caloric Restriction), namely, to reduce 1 / 3 of food, timing quantity to mice eating, will
    significantly improve the mice health and prolong their life. This is an indisputable fact that a large number of
    experiments have been proved.</p>

<p>Perhaps the reasons for learning Chinese Traditional Medicine origin, Food should be diet to 70% on it, is the
    ancient legend of the health proverbs, and the only right and proper and just. Then enter the Japanese Takeda of
    Kyoto University professor of aging biology labs, took over the management of SAM Mouse (Senescence Accelerated
    Mouse), feel hard to say that the lab mouse to eat less, is only just returning to normal food intake. Because in
    the laboratory cages, the mouse 24 hours is no shortage of food and water, while the nature of eating rodents, and
    there is grinding habits, and ultimately, too abundant. Therefore, this argument calorie restriction, and perhaps
    should be changed to limit overeating, and thus also to improve because of excessive eating in mice caused by
    short-lived phenomenon.</p>

<h2 id="introCM">Introduction to Chinese Medicine (Acupuncture, Herb Medicine and Qigong)</h2>

<p class="firstP">Jing Luo ( Meridians and collaterals ) is all important component part in the basic theory of Traditional Chinese
    Medicine . It has the guiding significance in various clinical branches, particularly in the clinical Zhen Jiu
    treatment</p>

<p>Jing Luo is a general term of Jingmai( Meridians ) and Luomai ( collaterals ) in the human body. The differentiation
    of Meridians from collaterals is that Jingmai ( Meridians ) is the main stem of the Meridians and collaterals which
    circulates straightly and distributes in the deeper layer as the stomach Meridian of foot Yangming connecting the
    superior, inferior, internal and external contrary, Luomai ( collaterals )is the branch of the Meridians which
    circulates traversely and obliquely in the shallow layer as the lung Meridian of hand Taiyin, thinner and smaller,
    and runs over the whole body in a crisscross fashion.</p>

<p>Jing Luo Function: Jing Luo( Meridians and collaterals ) belongs to internal organs (Zang-fu) and exteriorly to all
    the extremities. It functions as organic corresponding network between internal organs and body sur face . So the
    human body is an organic whole, jingmai ( Meridians ) and Luomai( collaterals ) serve as harmonious and well
    balanced condition.</p>

<p>Jing Luo Contents: The theory of ding Luo( Meridians and collaterals ) is rich in content: the twelve regular
    Jingmai( Meridians ) and the twelve subsidiary Jing types of the twelve Meridians , the twelve Jing Jin ( muscle
    meridian) and the Luo( collaterals ), minute collaterals superficial collaterals . This section pays special
    attention to the introduction of the twelve regular Meridians , and Ren and Du Meridians . Generally they are called

<h2 id="history">Brief History of Acupuncture</h2>

<p class="firstP">In the ancient literature since the sixth century B.C., there was the record of &quot;treatment of disease with stone
    needle&quot;. The earliest needle was made of stone. In Huangdi Neijing ( Huangdi's Canon of Medicine) published
    over 2,000 years ago, silk medical books unearthed in the modern times and ancient Chinese classics, there was the
    description about how to treat disease with stone needle. In the 1960s, a stone needle was found in the ruins of now
    Stone Age in the north of China. With the development of metallurgy, needles were gradually made of bronze, iron,
    gold and silver. Huangdi Neijing ( Huangdi's Canon of Medicine) mentions &quot;Nine Needles&quot;, the relics of
    which were found in archaeology. The materials used for moxibustion were various in the early practice, gradually
    moxa was selected as the most suitable material for performing moxibustion.</p>

<p>In using acupuncture and moxibustion to treat disease, people discovered some therapeutic rules. Purposeful study of
    these rules led 1o theoretical cognition like the conception of meridians. In the silk medical books unearthed in
    the tomb of West Hah Dynasty in 1970s in Mawangdui, Changsha City, Hunan Province, there are the descriptions of
    eleven meridians named as &quot;Eleven meridians of foot and arm for moxibustion&quot; and &quot;Eleven yin and yang
    meridians for moxibustion&quot;.</p>

<p>Huangdi Neijing ( Huangdi's Canon on Medicine) compiled in the Hah Dynasty contains rich knowledge of acupuncture and
    moxibustion, including meridians, acupoints, needling methods, indications and cautions as well as therapeutic
    principles, tenets, diagnosis and syndrome differentiation. Huangdi Neijing ( Huangdi's Canon on Medicine) lays the
    foundation for the theory of acupuncture and moxibustion and guides the development of such a unique specialty.</p>

<p>Zhenjiu Jiayijing ( A-B Classics ~a Acupuncture and Moxibustion) compiled by Huangfu Mi in the Jin Dynasty is a
    collection of the related contents in Huangdi Neijing ( Huangdi's Canon on Medicine) and Mingtang Kongxue Zhenjiu
    Zhiyao and described the locations, indications and needling methods of 349 acupoints as well as specific treatments
    for various diseases.</p>

<p>Sun Simiao, a great doctor in the Tang Dynasty, described Ashi Point and moxibustion methods for healthcare in
    Qianjin Fang (Golden Prescriptions) with colored illustrations of meridians. This book also contains many
    therapeutic methods for various diseases. In the book Waitai Miyao written by Wang Tao contains rich methods for
    performing moxibustion, which has promoted the development of moxibustion therapy. In the Imperial Medical Bureau,
    acupuncture and moxibustion became an independent specialty practiced by doctors, assistants and acupuncturist who
    were also responsible for teaching.</p>

<p>In the 11th century A. D. , Wang Weiyi, an official in charge of medicine in the government in the Song nasty,
    rectified 354 acupoints and compiled Tongren Shuxue Zhenjiu Tujing ( Diagrams of Meridians and Acupoints on Bronze
    Figure) which was published nationally. Two bronze figures, the normal size of man, were modeled for teaching and
    examination of acupuncture and moxibustion. Such an improvement promoted the unity in the location of acupoints and
    education of acupuncture and moxibustion.</p>

<p>In the Jin and Yuan Dynasties, there was further development in the theory of meridians, methods for selecting
    acupoints and needling techniques. Hua Boren, a celebrated doctor in the Yuan Dynasty, believed that the governor
    and conception vessels were as important as the twelve meridians. Therefore he called them four teen meridians and
    described meridians and acupoints according to the fourteen meridians in his book Shisijin Fahui (Elucidation of
    Fourteen Meridians). Such an arrangement was helpful for understanding and using the theory of meridians and
    acupoints in the later generations. Famous doctors like He Ruoyu and Dou Hanqing thought highly of midnight-noon
    ebb-flow method for selecting acupoints and described such away to use acupoints in their books~ and therefore
    enriching the content of time medicine. Dou Hanqing also developed the methods of needling by putting forward the
    methods of cold and heat reinforcing and reducing needling.</p>

<p>In the Ming Dynasty, acupuncture and moxibustion developed to its peak remarked by publication of many monographs on
    acupuncture and moxibustion, active academic discussion and further development of needling methods, meridian theory
    and therapeutic methods Yang Jizhou, a famous doctor then, compiled Zhenjiu Dacheng (Compendium of Acupuncture arid
    Moxibustion) by summarizing the experience of his own and many others'. Xu Feng described many needling methods in
    his book Zhenjiu Quan (A Comprehensive Collection of Acupuncture and Moxibustion) which further enriched the content
    of needling methods.</p>

<p>Books on acupuncture and moxibustion published in the Qing Dynasty lacked innovative development. In the middle of
    the Qing Dynasty the specialty of acupuncture and moxibustion was banned in the Imperial Hospital. However, folk
    practice was still extensive.</p>

<p>After the founding of the People's Republic of China and owing to the policy made by the government for developing
    traditional Chinese medicine, the academic studies of acupuncture and moxibustion have developed fast. The rapid
    development of acupuncture and moxibustion is marked by extensive application of acupuncture and moxibustion
    therapy, higher education, establishment of academic institutes, recompilation of ancient classics, publication of a
    great number of academic books and journals, thorough studies on the meridians, acupoints, needling and moxibusting
    methods and tenets of acupuncture and moxibustion therapy as well as development of various needling methods like
    acupuncture anesthesia and devices for performing acupuncture and moxibustion.</p>

<p>Acupuncture and moxibustion spread to the other century A.D., Zhenjiu Jiayijing ( A-B Classics on Acupuncture and
    Moxibustion ) was spread to Korea and Japan. In 552 A. D. the Chinese Government then presented a set of Zhenjing
    (Acupuncture Canon ) to Japanese Emperor. In the Tang Dynasty, Qianjin Fang (Golden Prescriptions) and Waitai Miyao
    were brought to Korea. Following the example of the Tang Dynasty, Japan also established acupuncture and moxibustion
    specialty and Korea appointed doctorate position for acupuncture. The textbooks used were Zhengjjing (Acupuncture
    Canon) and Zhengjiu Jiayijing ( A-B Classics on Acupuncture and Moxibustion ). In the 17th century, acupuncture and
    moxibustion was spread to Europe. Since 1950s, many countries have sent doctors to China to study acupuncture and
    moxibustion. Chinese government has sent acupuncture and moxibustion experts group abroad to offer clinical
    treatment. Since 1975, to meet file requirement of WHO, China has set up international training centers for
    acupuncture and moxibustion in Beijing, Shanghai and Nanjing to train acupuncture and moxibustion doctors for a
    number of countries. Currently acupuncture and moxibustion therapy has been used in about 100 countries and regions.
    A number of international academic organizations have been set up. In 1987, Federation of World Acupuncture and
    Moxibustion Society were established in China and many international conferences have been held since then. The
    science of acupuncture and moxibustion has developed smoothly in the whole world.</p>

<p><strong>Development of acupuncture and moxibustion prescription on the relationship between the main
    acupoints</strong></p>

<p>Acupuncture prescription, that is, the use of clinical acupuncture point program, including force and with a single
    point at the point prescription. One point is the use of acupuncture treatment prescriptions disease, a disease for
    only one acupoints for acupuncture or moxibustion with a point program; with points is the use of acupuncture
    treatment prescriptions disease, a condition for matching a few acupoints combination with the points
    program. Indications of acupuncture prescription and acupoints are two different concepts. Indications are that
    acupoint acupoints effect, that a certain acupoints to treat certain diseases, or certain diseases can be treated
    with a certain acupoints. Ancient medical books, the indications of acupoints in two formats, a point or a few main
    points of a disease, that so-called &quot;point system disease&quot;; a certain disease, a hole or a few main points
    of. &quot;Lord&quot; means &quot;attending the&quot;, although the disease in the former, the latter point, but with
    &quot;Lord&quot; should be clearly pointed out the indications of acupoints. Indications listed in the provisions of
    acupoints disease. Listed for various diseases, disorders can be no association between. Acupuncture is a disease in
    the former format prescribed acupoints in the post. Disease or a separate listed disease or disorder, or a
    composition of interrelated evidence Hou different symptoms, listed in the acupuncture acupoints have to point out
    the specific methods, such as superficial, deep acupuncture, moxibustion strong number, or fill or diarrhea and so
    on.</p>

<p>&quot;The B&quot;, &quot;dry gold to party&quot; and &quot;acupuncture-owned by Health&quot; will be attending
    acupoints were classified according to different disease induction, these books set out the provisions of acupoint
    indications in the disease although it has also single, is not the acupuncture prescription but acupoints attending
    a special presentation, we call it the Lord acupoints to show the acupoints and acupuncture prescription and
    indications of the difference.Lord acupoints can be called a &quot;hole Lord,&quot; &quot;Lord of the hole,&quot;
    the name first appeared in the &quot;dry gold to party&quot; refers to the indications of acupoints and
    corresponding relationship between the disease, or dozens of points of a disease can be cured, or the number of
    patients Indications of a point. In this paper, the main acupoints acupuncture prescription and analysis of, and
    then discusses the development and prescription of acupuncture acupoints on the relationship between the Lord.</p>

<p>One. &quot;The B&quot; to collate and analyze Indications of Acupoints</p>

<p>&quot;The B&quot; is the oldest system of acupuncture works for Mi Jin essays, is a collection of &quot;Q&quot;,
    &quot;needle, and the&quot; Ming Tang Acupuncture cavity to &quot;compiled from the three books. The current spread
    of the &quot;B by&quot; The book is twelve volumes. Juan Qi second line to the volume of various acupoints Syndrome
    treatment.Generally believed that the &quot;B by the&quot; VII to the second volume of the articles mentioned in
    various acupoints Syndrome treatment is the prescription. We have made a special study of its determined that it is
    not acupuncture prescription, are indications of acupoints are summarized according to the indications of acupoints
    about the disease and syndrome classification carried out finishing.</p>

<p>Although the &quot;B by&quot; VII to the second volume in particular, recorded content from &quot;out of the party
    hole Acupuncture to&quot; the contents of most of the original non-acupuncture prescription, but many generations
    mistakenly viewed as a prescription of acupuncture and the &quot;B by &quot;A lot more than attending the provisions
    of the inclusion of a point, so that future generations with an objective point on the disclosure of the initial
    prescription.<br/>
    &quot;Qian Jin Yao Fang&quot; in the &quot;cavity Lord&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Lord&quot; is attending the meaning of &quot;right&quot; is the corresponding mean. &quot;The main cavity of
    the&quot; hole that is attending, referring to the corresponding acupoints attending relationship with the
    disease. We call it the main acupoints right. &quot;Dry gold to side&quot; Volume three decades: &quot;Where the
    cloud cavity Lord who were in the hole, the symptoms in the next, there are dozens of points or a disease, or a
    total number of disease stay long temporary discretion, practice with it.&quot; &quot; cavity Lord &quot;is not a
    prescription of acupoint acupoints with the relationship between the primary and secondary. &quot;Dry gold to side,
    thirty volumes listed in&quot; The Lord cavities, &quot;provisions, a large part of only one acupoint, the so-called&quot;
    point total of the number of diseases, &quot;such as&quot; and the main air headache liao &quot;,&quot; Court of the
    Lord God of Wind dizziness , good vomit full of trouble. &quot; Does not exist between the corresponding primary and
    secondary acupoints, apparently is still attending the provisions of acupoints &quot;to point system certificate&quot;
    form of expression. As to the alleged &quot;one disease, there are dozens of points&quot; is actually a &quot;B by
    the&quot; in &quot;to point check against&quot; the continuation of the prescription points do not exist with the
    form of primary and secondary distribution points.</p>

<p>But &quot;Qian Jin Yi Fang&quot; Volume sixteen content is planted with &quot;dry gold to party&quot; thirty
    different volumes. &quot;Qian Jin Yi Fang&quot; Volume sixteen exception of a few attending several provisions in
    the acupoints. Most of the acupuncture prescription. The wording of the form: first words Syndrome, sub-statement of
    acupoints, and then detailing the specific acupoints thorn moxibustion methods. &quot;Dry Gold Wing side,&quot;
    Volume II is divided into sixteen women all kinds of diseases, pediatric epilepsy shock, nasal, tongue disease,
    beriberi, etc. twenty-seven, each chapter's first title, &quot;Law xx first,&quot; such as women Second Law Act
    forty-five following forty-five acupuncture prescription. The &quot;dry side wings of gold&quot; and &quot;Qian Jin
    Yao Fang&quot; two books were read, not difficult to find, &quot;Qian Jin Yi Fang&quot; Volume sixteen in the
    prescription of acupuncture is scattered in 75 &quot;dry gold to side,&quot; Volume II nineteenth and than thirty
    volumes of the acupuncture prescription order.</p>

<p>According to statistics, the &quot;dry side payments to&quot; roll the provisions of the Lord thirty the number of
    cavities, six single article2</p>
