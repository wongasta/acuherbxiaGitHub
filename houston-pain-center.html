<h2 id="painCenter">Pain Center</h2>

<p class="firstP">Pain is more common reason people visits acupuncture clinic in China and US, in history and
    now. Acupuncture is naturally, safety and effective treatment for pain relief and pain management; follow
    pain conditions are mostly have effective result by acupuncture therapy.</p>

<h2 id="lowerBackPain">Lower Back Pain</h2>

<p class="firstP">Back pain in the lower back or low back pain is not a specific disease, it is a symptom that may occur
    from a
    variety of different processes. In up to 85% of people with low back pain, despite a thorough medical
    examination, no specific cause of the pain can be identified.</p>

<h3>Back Pain and Acupuncture therapy</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Musculoskeletal pain syndromes that produce low back pain include myofascial pain syndromes and
        fibromyalgia.
    </li>
    <li>Injuries: Spine injuries such as sprains and fractures can cause either short-lived or chronic pain.
        Sprains are tears in the ligaments that support the spine, and they can occur from twisting or lifting
        improperly. Fractured vertebrae are often the result of osteoporosis, a condition that causes weak,
        porous bones. Less commonly, back pain may be caused by more severe injuries that result from accidents
        and falls.
    </li>
    <li>Nerve root syndromes are those that produce symptoms of nerve impingement (a nerve is touched), often
        due to a herniation (or bulging) of the disc between the lower back bones. Sciatica is an example of
        nerve root impingement, Spinal stenosis and Spinal degeneration.
    </li>
    <li>Other Acquired conditions and diseases: Many medical problems can cause or contribute to back pain. They
        include scoliosis, which causes curvature of the spine and does not usually cause pain until mid-life;
        spondylolisthesis; various forms of arthritis, including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and
        ankylosing spondylitis; and spinal stenosis, a narrowing of the spinal column that puts pressure on the
        spinal cord and nerves. While osteoporosis itself is not painful, it can lead to painful fractures of
        the vertebrae. Other causes of back pain include pregnancy; kidney stones or infections; endometriosis,
        which is the buildup of uterine tissue in places outside the uterus; and fibromyalgia, which causes
        fatigue and widespread muscle pain.
    </li>
    <li>Infections and tumors: They are not common causes of back pain, infections can cause pain when they
        involve the vertebrae, a condition called osteomyelitis, or when they involve the discs that cushion the
        vertebrae, which is called discitis. Tumors, too, are relatively rare causes of back pain. Occasionally,
        tumors begin in the back, but more often they appear in the back as a result of cancer that has spread
        from elsewhere in the body.
    </li>
    <li>Although the causes of back pain are usually physical, it is important to know that emotional stress can
        play a role in how severe pain is and how long it lasts. Stress can affect the body in many ways,
        including causing back muscles to become tense and painful.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>In the early stage of low back pain, acupuncture mostly have good result for relief the pain, many acute low
    back pains can be reliefed after first treatment with one or few needles. The chronic back pain or stiffness
    may improve after few time of the treatment, some take more long time to get benefit. Acupuncture also can
    do pain management by couple times treatment between a year.</p>

<p>The None Primary low back pain, acupuncture therapy may relief the pain but need original cause treatment for
    like osteoporosis, arthritis or tumor.</p>

<p>Prevention</p>
<ul>
    <li>Qigong and mostly Chinese traditional exercises like Tai-ji. Xin-yi, all those can get huge benefits
        from back pain to whole body wellness, but often take long time training and exercise.
    </li>
    <li>Lumbar support belts: Workers who frequently perform heavy lifting are often required to wear these
        belts. There is no proof that these belts prevent back injury. One study even indicated that these belts
        increased the likelihood of injury.
    </li>
    <li>Standing: While standing, keep your head up and stomach pulled in. If you are required to stand for long
        periods of time, you should have a small stool on which to rest one foot at a time. Do not wear high
        heels.
    </li>
    <li>Sitting: Chairs of appropriate height for the task at hand with good lumbar support are preferable. To
        avoid putting stress on the back, chairs should swivel. Automobile seats should also have adequate
        low-back support. If not, a small pillow or rolled towel behind the lumbar area will provide adequate
        support.
    </li>
    <li>Sleeping: Individual tastes vary. If the mattress is too soft, many people will experience backaches.
        The same is true for sleeping on a hard mattress. Trial and error may be required. A piece of plywood
        between the box spring and mattress will stiffen a soft bed. A thick mattress pad will help soften a
        mattress that is too hard.

<h2 id="neckPain">Neck Pain</h2>

<h3>Signs and symptoms</h3>

<p class="firstP">Neck pain takes many forms. Signs and symptoms of neck pain may include:</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>Pain in your neck that may feel sharp or dull</li>
    <li>Stiffness in your neck</li>
    <li>Difficulty going about your daily tasks because of pain or stiffness in your neck</li>
    <li>Shoulder pain in addition to neck pain, in some cases</li>
    <li>Back pain in addition to neck pain, in some cases</li>
</ul>
<h3>Causes</h3>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>Muscle strains. Overuse, such as too much time spent hunched over a steering wheel, often triggers muscle
        strains. Neck muscles, particularly those in the back of your neck, become fatigued and eventually strained.
        When you overuse your neck muscles repeatedly, chronic pain can develop. Even such minor things as reading in
        bed or gritting your teeth can strain neck muscles.
    </li>
    <li>Worn joints. Like the other joints in your body, your neck joints experience wear and tear with age, which can
        cause osteoarthritis in your neck. Neck (cervical) osteoarthritis can cause pain and stiffness in your neck.
    </li>
    <li>Disk disorders. As you age, the cushioning disks between your vertebrae become dry and stiff, narrowing the
        spaces in your spinal column where the nerves come out. The disks in your neck also can herniate. This means the
        inner gelatinous cartilage material of a disk protrudes through the disk's tougher cartilage covering. Neck pain
        may occur or nearby nerves can be irritated. Other tissues and bony growths (spurs) also can press on your
        nerves as they exit your spinal cord, causing pain.
    </li>
    <li>Injuries. Rear-end collisions often result in whiplash injuries, which occur when the head is jerked forward and
        back, stretching the soft tissues of the neck beyond their limits.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Like situation in low back pain, acute, early stage of pain onset or injury will be easy to cure or improve, in
    chronic or with long history, may need more long time to improve the pain. Now, more common cause is the stress,
    people work on computer with too long time.</p>

<h2 id="footPain">Foot Pain, Ankle Pain and Heel Pain</h2>

<p class="firstP">Foot pain can be caused by:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Bunions -- a protrusion at the base of the big toe, which can become inflamed. Bunions often develop over time
        from wearing narrow-toed shoes.
    </li>
    <li>Hammer toes -- toes that curl downward into a claw-like position.
    </li>
    <li>Calluses and corns -- thickened skin from friction or pressure. Calluses are on the balls of the feet or heels.
        Corns appear on your toes.
    </li>
    <li>Plantar warts -- from pressure on the soles of your feet.
    </li>
    <li>Fallen arches -- also called flat feet.
    </li>
    <li>Broken bones 
    </li>
    <li>Stress fracture
    </li>
    <li>Arthritis </li>
    <li>Gout -- common in the big toe, which becomes red, swollen, and very tender
    </li>
    <li>Plantar fasciitis -- see heel pain
    </li>
    <li>Bone spur -- see heel pain
    </li>
    <li>Sprains -- see ankle pain
    </li>
    <li>Bursitis of the heel -- see heel pain
    </li>
    <li>Tendinitis -- see heel pain
    </li>
    <li>Osteoarthritis 
    </li>
    <li>Rheumatoid arthritis 
    </li>
    <li>Chronic gouty arthritis 
    </li>
    <li>Psoriatic arthritis 
    </li>
    <li>Septic arthritis</li>
    <li>Heel bursitis (inflammation of the back of the heel) can be caused by landing hard or awkwardly on the heel, or
        by pressure from shoes.
    </li>
    <li>Achilles tendinitis is inflammation of the large tendon.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>The more often cause of foot problem in my office is heel and ankle pain by stress, over weight or injury, if foot
    pain related with low back pain, may need treatment both foot and low back pain.</p>

<h2 id="kneePain">Knee Pain</h2>

<p class="firstP">Knee pain usually results from overuse, poor form during physical activity, not warming up or cooling
    down, or
    inadequate stretching. Simple causes of knee pain often clear up on their own with self care. Being overweight can
    put you at greater risk for knee problems.</p>

<p>Knee pain can be caused by:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Arthritis -- including rheumatoid, osteoarthritis, and gout<br/>
    </li>
    <li>Baker's cyst -- a fluid-filled swelling behind the knee that may accompany inflammation from other causes, like
        arthritis<br/>
    </li>
    <li>Bursitis -- inflammation from repeated pressure on the knee, such as kneeling for long periods of time, overuse,
        or injury<br/>
    </li>
    <li>Connective tissue disorders such as lupus<br/>
    </li>
    <li>Dislocation of the kneecap<br/>

<h2 id="shoulderPain">Shoulder Pain</h2>

<p><strong>Causes </strong></p>

<p>The tendons pass underneath a rigid bony arch in the shoulder. The most common cause of shoulder pain is when the
    tendons become trapped under this arch. The compressed tendons become inflamed or damaged, a condition called
    rotator cuff tendinitis. This can occur from general wear and tear as you get older, an activity that requires
    constant shoulder use like baseball pitching, or an injury.</p>

<p>Shoulder pain can also be due to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Arthritis in the joints about the shoulder (gradual narrowing of the joints and loss of protective cartilage).
    </li>
    <li>Bursitis (inflammation of a fluid-filled sac, or bursa, that lies between tendon and skin or between tendon and
        bone). Normally a bursa protects the joint and helps make movement more fluid.
    </li>
    <li>Fractures of the shoulder bones.
    </li>
    <li>Frozen shoulder syndrome occurs when you don't move your shoulder because of pain or injury. The muscles or
        connective structures stiffen up inside the shoulder and make any motion painful and difficult.
    </li>
    <li>Inflammation of nearby tendons, such as those connected to the bicep muscles of your arms, from overuse or
        injury.

<h2 id="agingCenter">Acupuncture Aging Center</h2>

<p class="firstP">2000 years ago reveals a fable in China, the Emperor Qin ShiHuang sent 500 boys and girls led by a
    Taoist priest
    boated toward the sun rise palace to look for the immortal herbal medicine for the emperor. Unfortunately the
    emperor didn't live long enough for them to come back. Even now some people still believe that the progenies of that
    500 boys and girls still walk on earth.</p>

<p>1990s, when I was PhD student in the Department of Senescence Biology, Kyoto University, Japan, I heard some private
    conversations after conferences, &quot;are you trying to get people to live a longer life of 100 or 200 years?&quot;,
    the answer is &quot;No, our goal is to understanding the aging, to hope we live a healthier and high quality of
    senor life.&quot; In my opinion the concept of anti-aging is not the power of immortality, but that of betterment to
    our aging process.</p>

<p>The Chinese have a history of pursuing anti-aging, wellness, or long for all the region and group of people. We
    practiced the concept of Qigong, Taiji, herbal medicine treatments, acupuncture, and the harmony of warm and cold
    property of food to fit different body types. Modern science discovered the specific genes like aging -1 in worms
    and the theory of calorie restriction diet for anti-aging. However, I have always thought about &quot;what is the
    process of aging?&quot; and &quot;what is the cross point for both Traditional Chinese Medicine and modern science
    to understand the aging process?&quot; It is important to realize for the second question that the target and goal
    is the same, the human body. Now we understand the fundamentals of aging including genetics, environments and life
    styles, it is important for us to realize all these elements make up the process of aging.</p>

<p>The Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has a principle theory to understanding the human body and aging. To my
    understandings, the keyword of the theory is Qi energy. Negative factors such as stresses, diseases, aging will harm
    the Qi energy when we get sick, become stressed out and deteriorate from aging. Through the negative factors the Qi
    energy will be weakened, and finally all the Qi energy will be lost and the life will come to an end. The
    acupuncture, Chinese herbal medicine, and traditional exercises training such as Qigong, Taiji, Bagua, or Xinyi, all
    are treatments of Qi energy. These practices will cultivate, smoothen the flow of Qi energy. This way the Qi
    energy will flow stronger through the channel of our bodies. The body &quot;channel&quot; is a TCM conception that
    is similar to that of a highway network connection that links each parts of our body. This way we will provide
    maintenance to our health, and a brake to the process of aging. If the Qi energy is sufficient in the whole body and
    local organ system, all the symptoms are possible for improvement, such as chronic fatigue, pain management, memory
    loss, sexual problem, constipation and loss of bladder control.</p>

<p>We say that mostly aging health problems are the result of insufficient and weakness of the Qi energy. Memory loss,
    chronic fatigue, and various pain problems are the common symptoms that can occur to the elderly. Thus the
    acupuncture treatments or Chinese herbal medicines have to concentrate on the whole body to supplement the Qi
    energy. When the entire body's condition has improved, the specific problem will be improved too. For example, in
    case of foot pain, treatments involve combination of inserting acupuncture needles into foot and additional needle
    and herbal treatment for some other body organs. This way the treatments will not only solve the problem of foot
    pain, but also the Qi energy will receive more effective results. Additionally, the traditional therapy or exercises
    combining medication may be helpful for individuals to manage their health.</p>

<p>Risk of diseases is increase through the aging process, and various diseases are more common to target the elder
    people (senior). The diseases include cancer, arthritis, and Alzheimer's disease. The following are some typical
    changes we can expect when we get older.</p>

<h2 id="cardiovascularSystem">Cardiovascular System</h2>

<p class="firstP">Elder people's heart muscle will be less efficient pump, and the blood vessels become less elastic.
    Hardened fatty
    deposits may form on the walls of your arteries (atherosclerosis), narrowing the passageway through the vessels.
    This can lead to high blood pressure (hypertension).</p>

<p>Now few theories try to explain the relationship of aging process of cardiovascular: oxidative stress appears to be
    the primary explanation for aging in the cardiovascular system. Hypertension, diabetes and insulin resistance, which
    are associated with aging, contribute to vascular malfunction, altering the aging mechanisms of blood vessels.</p>

<h2 id="bones">Bones, muscles and joints</h2>

<p class="firstP">The bones reach maximum mass between ages 25 and 35, when increase of age, bone density will gradual
    loss, bone
    become weakens and more susceptible to fracture (osteoporosis). Muscles, tendons and joints generally lose some
    strength and flexibility too.</p>

<h2 id="arthritis">Common kinds of Arthritis</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common type of arthritis in older people, other name known as degenerative
        arthritis, degenerative joint disease, hypertrophic arthritis, because the cartilages become ragged and wears
        away. Cartilage is the part of the joint that cushions the ends of the bones and allows easy movement of joints.
        OA symptoms can range from stiffness and mild pain that comes and goes with activities like walking, bending,
        may have joint soreness, morning stiffness, Grating or catching when moving the knee, weakened large thigh
        muscles.
    </li>
    <li>Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) - RA is an autoimmune disease that leads to inflammation in joints and tissue around
        the joints. This inflammation causes pain, swelling, and stiffness that lasts for hours. People of any age can
        develop RA, and it is more common in women. RA can attack almost any joint in the body, including the joints in
        the fingers, wrists, shoulders, elbows, hips, knees, ankles, feet, and neck. RA not only destroys joints. It can
        also attack organs such as the heart, muscles, blood vessels, nervous system, and eyes.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="cancer">Cancer</h2>

<p class="firstP">Cancer is an abnormal growth of cells, also call malignancy because the cell tends to growth in an
    uncontrolled way,
    to metastasize (spread).</p>

<p>Cancer is primarily a disease of aging, about ten times more likely than younger persons to develop cancer, because
    of their longer exposure to carcinogens: pollution, radiation, tobacco, sun, alcohol, wrong diet, chemical or
    physical irritation and stress.</p>

<p>Other hands, because the body DNA repair function less effective as we grow older. I would like to believe the life
    style and aging are more important factors in cancer development.</p>

<p>For cancer prevention, take care the health life style and avoid risk factors, cancer-causing agents in the
    environment and the workplace. Have good health maintain, righter diet, stress management and exercises, and get
    help to treatment illness or uncomfortable in early. Because mostly cancers are a result of many years development,
    so to prevention of cancer, we need do some things for our body start from now.</p>

<p><strong>Life After Cancer</strong></p>

<p>Cancer patients after surgery to prevent metastasis and recurrence of residual tumor?   The face of long-term
    radiotherapy and chemotherapy, the patient how to deal with unbearable?   In addition to surgery and radiotherapy
    and chemotherapy in addition, can with other treatments to increase the patient's energy?   Now, in line with
    acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine treatment, is being more accepted.</p>

<p>In general, cancer mortality rates for two reasons: early diagnosis of low and high rate of recurrence and
    metastasis.   According to statistics, death within one year after surgery 80% of cancer patients died of recurrence
    and metastasis Therefore, Increase the body's own immune system , which can effectively remove residual tumor cells
    in vivo, will help cancer patients live long-term health after cancer.</p>

<p> Today, effective anti-cancer understandable way, while by surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, tumor eradication,
    while from the immune, endocrine, neurological, metabolic and other point of an integrated intervention force with
    the body's own cancer cells or cause cancer cells to clear, or   minimize the possibility of carcinogenesis.   The
    best treatment of the cancer is cancer prevention, should be following the surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy
    after traditional treatment.   Efficacy through a comprehensive, effective way to boost anti-tumor immune response,
    killing tumor cells; reduce bone marrow suppression, elevated white blood cells, reduce chemotherapy induced ulcers,
    inflammation and other side effects and improve tolerance and effectiveness of radiotherapy and chemotherapy; etc.,
    to improve the quality of life in patients after cancer and prolong survival.  </p>

<h2 id="kidneys"><strong>Kidneys, bladder and urinary tract</strong></h2>

<p>With increase of age, kidneys become less efficient in removing waste from bloodstream. Some conditions, such as
    diabetes or high blood pressure, and some medications may damage kidneys more.</p>

<p>About 30 percent of people age 65 and older experience a loss of bladder control (urinary incontinence). Incontinence
    also more common happens people have a number of health problems, such as obesity, frequent constipation and chronic
    cough.</p>

<p>Women are more likely than men to have incontinence, because the menopause might experience stress incontinence. In
    men, incontinence may caused by an enlarged prostate (BPH, Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia), which can block the
    urethra.</p>

<h2 id="brain">Brain and nervous system</h2>

<p>Memory loss is common condition in elder people, because the number of brain cells (neurons) decreases with age.
    Other as reflexes becomes slower, and less of coordinate.</p>

<h2 id="stroke">Stroke</h2>

<p>There are two major types of strokes. The most common kind (ischemic) is caused by blood clots or the narrowing of a
    blood vessel (artery) leading to the brain. The clot keeps blood from flowing into other regions of the brain and
    prevents needed oxygen and nutrients from reaching brain cells in these regions. The second major kind of stroke
    (hemorrhagic) happens when a broken blood vessel (artery) causes bleeding in the brain. This break also stops oxygen
    and nutrients from reaching brain cells. Acupuncture therapy is more common treatment for stroke recovery in China,
    for improve balance, coordination, pain, and speech.</p>

<h2 id="sexuality">Sexuality</h2>

<p>With age, sexual needs and performance may decrease. Vaginal dryness problem and painful sexual may common in women,
    because the less elastic of vaginas walls. Impotence or electric dysfunction (ED) becomes more common in men as age
    over 65.</p>

<h2 id="otherAging">Other Aging Problems</h2>

<p>Cataracts, glaucoma and macular degeneration are the most common problems of aging eyes.</p>

<p>Tea loss, mouth feels drier and gums have pulled back (receded).</p>

<p>Hearing loss, Constipation.</p>

<p>Skin thins and becomes less elastic and more fragile. Less of natural oils may make skin drier and more wrinkled. Age
    spots can occur, and skin tags are more common</p>

<p>By age 75, some people find that themselves waking up several times each night.</p>

<p>Because metabolism generally slows, body burns fewer calories, and decreased activity, resulting in unwanted weight
    gain in some older peoples.</p>

<h2 id="infertility">Infertility</h2>

<p>Infertility means not being able to become pregnant after a year of trying. If a woman keeps having miscarriages, it
    is also called infertility. Lots of couples have infertility problems. About a third of the time, infertility can be
    traced to the woman. In another third of cases, it is because of the man. The rest of the time, it is because of
    both partners or no cause is found.</p>

<p>Causes of female infertility<br/>
</p>

<p>The most common causes of female infertility include fallopian tube damage or blockage, endometriosis, ovulation
    disorders, elevated prolactin, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), early menopause, benign uterine fibroids and pelvic
    adhesions.</p>

<p>Other health condition also causes or associated with female infertility: some medications, thyroid problems,
    radiation and chemotherapy.</p>

<p>Causes of male infertility<br/>
</p>

<p>Impaired sperm count or mobility: like impaired shape and movement of sperm, low sperm concentration, varicocele,
    undescended testicle, testosterone deficiency (male hypogonadism), Genetic defects, Infections.</p>

<p>Impaired delivery of sperm: sexual issues, problem with sexual intercourse or technique may affect fertility,
    erectile dysfunction, premature ejaculation, painful intercourse (dyspareunia), or psychological or relationship
    problems can contribute to infertility. Other like retrograde ejaculation, blockage of epididymis or ejaculatory
    ducts, no semen (ejaculate), misplaced urinary opening (hypospadias), anti-sperm antibodies.</p>

<p>General health and lifestyle issues: emotional stress, obesity, alcohol and drugs, and overexposure to certain
    environmental elements.</p>

<p>Acupuncture treatment for infertility</p>

<p>This is a nature therapy for infertility; in general, the principle idea is:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Treatment reproductive system local problems, like female's menstrual circle problem, hormone balance, chronic
        infection etc; in men, for example, treatment with erectile dysfunction, premature ejaculation, and improve the
        sperm delivery, sperm count and quality.
    </li>
    <li>Treatment whole body's health condition and wellness in both male and female. Some may need treatment for both
        local reproductive system and whole body health condition in same time.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>The treatment in my office usually uses both needle acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine, success pregnant mostly
    after 6 months to one year.</p>

<p>Depending on science paper and news report, acupuncture therapy may help increase the success rate of IVF, so some

    of needles. But it is not the case when you go to treat your infertility syndrome with Acupuncture . It, on the
    other hand, promises complete relaxation and instant cure from infertility .</p>

<p>Acupuncture is based on Chinese methods. The Chinese people believed that to remain healthy , energy should flow in a
    balanced way throughout your body. Whenever there is a blockage in the flow of that energy , inflammations will
    occur leading to severe pains and several types of diseases . Since energy flows the meridian points, so Acupuncture
    inserts needles in different parts of the body to make energy flow smoothly. Placing needles on certain points
    unblocks the energy points. This reduces the particular type of disease.</p>

<p>What Acupuncture treatment will suit you?</p>

<p>A close research on Acupuncture and infertility shows that treatment depends from person to person. However, you
    should visit the doctor, state your problem and know what Acupuncture diseases is right for you. Suggest every
    detail of your physical condition to the doctor and then go for particular Acupuncture remedy. Whether you are

    is also appropriate for those who do not want to undergo any costly fertility treatments . It is a safe, easy,
    reliable and painless method that provides fast relief from infertility . Acupuncture for infertility includes
    pricking of needles in the earlobes, eyebrows, eyelids, ears and fingertips. After the needles are pricked, the
    patient has to relax for 30 to 45 minutes. Acupuncture guarantees complete cure from infertility by just 3-4 regular
    sessions.</p>

<p>Other Chinese herbal treatments</p>

<p>Acupuncture for infertility can include auricular, electrified or manual treatments. Electrified means using of
    electric needles to cure pains and obstacles. Auricular treatment involving pricking of needles in the ears and
    earlobes is an alternative therapy for female infertility due to hormone disorders . Another method used during
    Acupuncture treatments for infertility includes usage of Chinese herbal medicines. Hachimijiogan is a Chinese herb
    that subsequently reduces serum prolactin level and results in normal ovulatory cycle and pregnancy . However, using
    rhubarb, endometriotic pill No 1 and Hochuekkito also reduces pelvic pain and intercourse pain , removes blood
    stasis , disintegrates mass and leads to purgation of serums.</p>

    stress . It also improves blood supply to the ovaries , and the uterus . This makes it easier for the uterus to
    nourish a fetus and reduce the risk of miscarriage effectively. Atlanta Acupuncture for infertility pregnancy
    suggests that the sessions stimulates the central nervous systems causing neurotransmitters and neurophormones to be
    released, thus reducing infertility effectively.</p>

<h2 id="weightLoss">Weight Loss and Ear Stapling</h2>

<p>The terms &quot;overweight&quot; and &quot;obesity&quot; refer to a person's overall body weight and where the extra
    weight comes from. Overweight is having extra body weight from muscle, bone, fat, and/or water. Obesity is having a
    high amount of extra body fat. The most useful measure of overweight and obesity is the body mass index (BMI). BMI
    is based on height and weight and is used for adults, children, and teens.</p>
<strong>Energy Balance</strong>

<p>For most people, overweight and obesity are caused by not having energy balance. Weight is balanced by the amount of
    energy or calories you get from food and drinks equaling the energy your body uses for things like breathing,
    digesting, and being physically active.</p>

<p>Simply say is eat too much and lack of exercises.</p>
